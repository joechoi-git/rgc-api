# rgc-api

This project was bootstrapped with [AWS Serverless Application Model Command Line Interface (AWS SAM CLI)](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/serverless-application-model/latest/developerguide/what-is-sam.html).
This is a Node.js app that provides REST API. It is hosted on [AWS Lambda](https://aws.amazon.com/lambda/features/) at <https://v936r8sd70.execute-api.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/Prod/concepts>.

## Stack

TypeScript, Node.js, Docker, and DynamoDB.

## Installation

```bash
git clone https://github.com/joechoi-git/rgc-api
cd rgc-api/app
app$: npm install
app$: cd ..
rgc-api$: sam build
rgc-api$: sam local start-api
# open http://localhost:3000/concepts 
```

## To deploy

```bash
sam build
sam deploy
# open https://v936r8sd70.execute-api.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/Prod/concepts
```

## Available API Endpoints

### Retrieve all concepts

```bash
curl https://v936r8sd70.execute-api.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/Prod/concepts
```

### Add or update a concept

```bash
curl -X POST https://v936r8sd70.execute-api.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/Prod/concepts \
     -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
     -d '{"id":"1", "displayName":"Some name",...}'
```

### Delete a concept

```bash
curl -X DELETE https://v936r8sd70.execute-api.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/Prod/concepts \
     -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
     -d '{"id":"1"}'
```

## Add a resource to your application

The application template uses AWS Serverless Application Model (AWS SAM) to define application resources. AWS SAM is an extension of AWS CloudFormation with a simpler syntax for configuring common serverless application resources such as functions, triggers, and APIs. For resources not included in [the SAM specification](https://github.com/awslabs/serverless-application-model/blob/master/versions/2016-10-31.md), you can use standard [AWS CloudFormation](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSCloudFormation/latest/UserGuide/aws-template-resource-type-ref.html) resource types.

## Fetch, tail, and filter Lambda function logs

To simplify troubleshooting, SAM CLI has a command called `sam logs`. `sam logs` lets you fetch logs generated by your deployed Lambda function from the command line. In addition to printing the logs on the terminal, this command has several nifty features to help you quickly find the bug.

`NOTE`: This command works for all AWS Lambda functions; not just the ones you deploy using SAM.

```bash
rgc-api$ sam logs -n FunctionName --stack-name rgc-api --tail
```

You can find more information and examples about filtering Lambda function logs in the [SAM CLI Documentation](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/serverless-application-model/latest/developerguide/serverless-sam-cli-logging.html).

## Unit tests

Tests are defined in the `app/tests` folder in this project. Use NPM to install the [Jest test framework](https://jestjs.io/) and run unit tests.

```bash
rgc-api$ cd app
app$ npm install
app$ npm run test
```

## Cleanup

To delete the sample application that you created, use the AWS CLI. Assuming you used your project name for the stack name, you can run the following:

```bash
sam delete --stack-name rgc-api
```

## Resources

See the [AWS SAM developer guide](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/serverless-application-model/latest/developerguide/what-is-sam.html) for an introduction to SAM specification, the SAM CLI, and serverless application concepts.

Next, you can use AWS Serverless Application Repository to deploy ready to use Apps that go beyond hello world samples and learn how authors developed their applications: [AWS Serverless Application Repository main page](https://aws.amazon.com/serverless/serverlessrepo/)
